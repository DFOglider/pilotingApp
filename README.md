# pilotingApp

UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This is a Shiny app that is intended to be used by pilots of
[SeaExplorer](https://www.alseamar-alcen.com/products/underwater-glider/seaexplorer)
gliders. The app downloads real-time data transmitted from the glider
over Iridium, processes it into a format suitable for plotting, and
then displays plots of the various fields of interest.
